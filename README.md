I am a learner of the ALX Software Engineering – Frontend Program, and I’m revamping my GitHub profile to reflect my growth, creativity, and curiosity.

🎨 I chose software engineering because I love creativity and building beautiful, functional websites. It has become my passion to bring ideas to life through code and design.

🌍 My goal in tech is to build scalable digital infrastructure that supports everyday life, especially in developing regions. I want to contribute to open-source tools that empower people, businesses, and communities to thrive.

I’m especially interested in:
-Front-end web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
-Infrastructure tools that support clean energy and digital access
-Continuous learning and building solutions that matter.

I believe that the best way to grow is by practicing and sharing. Here’s what I’m focusing on right now:
💡 Building responsive front-end projects with React
💡 Mastering Git/GitHub collaboration workflows
💡 Understanding the foundations of infrastructure tools and clean energy tech
💡 Practicing problem-solving with real-world tasks
